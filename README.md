**Ionic 2 - Creating Ionic apps with plugins to use a device's native features such as camera, notifications, etc**

This is an ionic application with 3 tabs. The camera plugin as well as saving photo to the device's native photo gallery is implemented in Tab 1. I *tried* to implement the image picker and crop plugins in tab 2 but this still needs some work.
